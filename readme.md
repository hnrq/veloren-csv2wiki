# Veloren CSV2Wiki

This code parses the CSV generated by `cargo csv-export` in Veloren to Wiki markup

## How to run it
This code needs Deno for running (I also don't know why I created it in Deno lol) and you can run it by using

```console
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --unstable index.js -i ./input/weaponstats.csv -o ./output/weapons.html
```
